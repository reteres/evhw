　　初冬，阳光一直很好，偶尔下雪，不到半天，屋顶的雪就变成了清水，从屋檐上连续下落。娘说，你早上懒得不起床，吃饭了去把你父亲的鞋子拿到李岩村补补吧。我想都没想，就答应了。相对于其他的活计，这活儿轻松，我自然愿意做。匆忙吞咽了一个馒头，喝了一碗米粥，提了父亲的鞋子，沿着一边的小路，往李岩村跑去了。
??“同学们啊，妖娆，想想，我们的家乡，大部分时候都妖娆得不得了啊！这‘分外妖娆’的意思，就是暖和得很了嘛！你们攒劲想一想，大雪过后，红气球一样的太阳升起来了，照在山冈上，照在原野里，照在村落中，照在大路小路上，照得到处到处都是红通通的，就像公社开大会时的那一大片坡大红旗，又明亮，又暖和，你们想，该有多么妖娆啊……”讲着讲着，老师的手慢慢挥开，挥开，眼渐渐闭拢，闭拢，头款款摇晃，摇晃，只怕是在品尝他正在讲着的妖娆滋味哩。
　　爱是雨后的傍晚，在遽然的雨幕后，就惊现了一弯彩虹，七彩的光彩在眼眸里闪耀，爱的寰球里，甘甜而神秘。而尔后，会有少许暗淡犹如墨染的心扉，就那么涂满爱的眸光，暗淡的夜幕，保持饱含着雨的滋润，湿淋淋的犹如依稀滴落的泪痕。爱在一朵秀美的虹间流逝。
Not only so, since I can remember, I knew every year, which dates when mother has always let left part in the tree, such as to eat in when his father came back from work.
Sometimes, the leaves on the trees quickly fall out, there is still a scarlet ZaoEr hanging on its top and is about to drip, quite attractive.
In fact, when my dad got home do not eat much, eat the most or our children.
I don't know if father during his lifetime remember and understand the mother's heart, but I was still want to come also very touched, I know in the hard days, mother love family how to running the household chores, she was using a special efforts and helpless love, borrow some poor day details of life, make public his near-perfect thick broad love sentiment long day.
13, the key to gain happiness is to cherish what you have forgotten what you have not.
